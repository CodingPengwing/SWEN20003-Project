# SWEN20003-Project
This is my solution to the semester-long project in SWEN20003-Object Oriented Software Development, 
the University of Melbourne. The project is based on a visual game where agents move around the map 
and collect/distribute items. The specifications are provided in the repo.

Run instructions:  
- IntelliJ: The package was built in Intellij, so it can just be cloned and built/run in IntelliJ.  

Arguments: args.txt is the file that determines the parameters of the program. It contains 3 arguments:
- Animation delay
- Max iterations
- Input file (some sample input files are provided in res/worlds)
